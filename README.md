# What is this?

If you're reading this, it likely means you've been shortlisted for an Elixir position at proSapient — congratulations!

You’ve been invited to the second stage of the interview, where you’ll be asked to build a small project in Elixir.\
Don't worry—this isn’t a LeetCode-style challenge or a generic coding test. Instead, we’ll give you a real-world task relevant to our work.

To help you prepare, we've put together a list of things to review before the interview.

# Preparation

Before the interview, please ensure that you:

- Have the latest versions of **Elixir**, **OTP**, and **PostgreSQL** installed.
- Check that your **editor** and **terminal** are set up and working correctly, as you’ll need them for the task.
- Make sure you are comfortable with your editor configuration. Check all tools that you are using regularly - formatting, autocomplete, copilots, etc.
- Review the [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction), as you’ll be using this API during the exercise.
- Familiarize yourself with **Elixir HTTP libraries**, as they will be required.
- Get comfortable using a collaborative whiteboarding tool like [Whiteboard](https://webwhiteboard.com/) or any similar service.

We look forward to seeing you in the next stage of the process. Good luck!
